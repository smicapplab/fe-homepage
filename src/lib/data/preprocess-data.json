		"question": "What is crowdfunding?",
		"answer": "Crowdfunding serves as a dynamic method for sourcing capital from investors to fuel diverse projects and businesses. There are several types of crowdfunding, including debt, equity, reward, and donation-based approaches. Koredor specializes in debt-based crowdfunding, wherein an SME's debt or borrowings are converted into a promissory (promise to pay) note, creating an avenue for a collective pool of investors to participate. With Koredor's crowdfunding concept, SEC-qualified individual and institutional investors can choose SMEs they wish to support, and the SME will repay the borrowed funds at the due date. This innovative form of fundraising presents a financing alternative for SMEs that are underserved or unserved by traditional financing institutions with more stringent and lengthy processes. Koredor's crowdfunding platform facilitates a relationship that connects SMEs with a pool of investors eager to contribute to their growth and success."
