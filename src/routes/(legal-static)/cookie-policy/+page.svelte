				<h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">Authentication and Third-Party Services</h2>
				<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
					We use modern authentication methods that may rely on secure tokens stored in your browser, rather than traditional cookies.

				</ul>
				<p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
